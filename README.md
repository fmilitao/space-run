# Space Run #

Collect as many circles as possible before the time runs out. Use "power brake" to do quick 90-degree turns without losing too much speed.

_Note:_ This idea does not work all that well as implemented...

## Play ##

[Play using all available play area](http://fmilitao.github.io/space-run/)

[Play using 800x600 play area](http://fmilitao.github.io/space-run/?w=800&h=600)

**Controls**:
  * Rotate left: `a`, `←`
  * Rotate right: `d`, `→`
  * Fire engines: `w`, `↑`
  * Brake: `s`, `space`, `↓`
  * Power Brake: hold both `Fire engines` and `Brake`

**URL Options**:
  * `d`, `debug` = `true` for debug mode
  * `w`, `h` = `int number` to pick specific world width/height
