#Space Run#

Collect as many circles as possible before the time runs out. Use "power brake" to do quick 90-degree turns without losing too much speed.


_Note:_ This idea does not work all that well as implemented...

**Controls**:
  * Rotate left: `a, ←`
  * Rotate right: `d, →`
  * Fire engines: `w, ↑`
  * Brake: `s, space, ↓`
  * Power Brake: hold both `Fire engines` and `Brake`

**URL Options**:
  * `d`, `debug` = `true` for debug mode
  * `w`, `h` = `int number` to pick specific world width/height

Example: `?debug=true&w=500&h=500` for debug mode in a 500x500 window.
